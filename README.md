This is a repository with various demos I created to learn the core of the massive Spring framework. I first started with XML configurations then moved on to created annotation versions of the same apps. From there I moved on to the MVC model using Dependency injection and  dispatchlet servlet.

The demos came from this Udemy course by Tim Buchalka and Bibhash Roy:

UPDATE: 
Also using great course from Udemy called Spring & Hibernate for Beginners by Chad Darby:
